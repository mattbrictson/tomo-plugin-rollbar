## Installation

Run:

```
$ gem install tomo-plugin-rollbar
```

Or add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tomo-plugin-rollbar"
```

Then add the following to `.tomo/config.rb`:

```ruby
plugin "rollbar"

set rollbar_env: "production"
set rollbar_token: "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

deploy do
  # ...
  # Place this task at *end* of the deploy
  run "rollbar:notify_deploy"
end
```

If you are not comfortable storing the `rollbar_token` in the configuration file, you can alternatively provide it via a `TOMO_ROLLBAR_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Tasks

### rollbar:notify_deploy

Sends an HTTP POST notification to the Rollbar API describing the release that was successfully deployed. This includes the user who performed the deploy, the environment, the git revision.

Note that this task must run _after_ `git:create_release` in the deploy sequence in order to have access to the release information.
